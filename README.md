# worldwarpaint
game about spreading paint all over the place!

It's a game written exclusively in ECMA6, using the phaser library. I use node6 and chrome to run it.

to run:
from the worldwarpaint directory run
node app_server/app_server.js

and

node game_server/game_server.js

these commands will start the app server and the game server respectively. The app server is the http server that serves the game files, and the game server is the websocket server that handles game mechanics.
